Naturally curious and analytical, I thrive on new challenges and constantly seek out learning opportunities to share knowledge.

I enjoy solving problems with data and technology, whether it's a personal project like creating a [music recommender model](https://brunoguratti.github.io/portfolio/music-recommender-system) to discover my next favorite track, or a professional challenge using data to uncover hidden business opportunities. Recently, I developed an [AI-powered log analytics system](https://brunoguratti.github.io/portfolio/talk2log) that transforms dense and complex log files from industrial control systems into engaging narratives using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Rerank models.

My work typically involves advanced analysis, statistical testing, predictive modeling, and the application of large language models.

I pivoted to data science in 2022, after working in manufacturing roles (which included some data analysis) for a decade. I've always been drawn to logic and technology, and to transform complex data into actionable insights that drive business decisions.

Currently working  in the AI industry analyzing data quality for a technology company focused on enterprise AI solutions. I hold a post-graduate degree in AI & Data Science from Loyalist College. I also volunteer as a Data Analytics Manager for the Federation of Canadian-Brazilian Businesses (FCBB), supporting Brazilian startups in expanding their operations to Canada.
