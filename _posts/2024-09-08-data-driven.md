title: 'The importance of data-driven decision making to business'
---

Despite the advance in data-driven decision making (DDDM) in modern business, surprisingly a huge number of companies still rely on gut instinct.

In fact, two-thirds of decision-makers at over 300 companies, according to Alation's "State of Data Culture" report released in 2020, focus on intuition rather than data. The primary reason: they believe their gut feel is the differentiator (42%).

Over-reliance on intuition can undermine the credibility of data and reveals a significant gap in the organization's ability to use data effectively.

ðŸ”… But why is the DDDM approach so important?

Data gives businesses the ability to make more intelligent decisions based on trends, patterns, and opportunities that might otherwise be unnoticed. It enables businesses to:

â–¶ Reach the target audience exactly and thus design products and services that suffice their needs. For instance, Netflix leverage user experience through data analytics to boost the user engagement time.

â–¶ Optimize pricing strategies based on real-time data analysis; for example, Uber applies dynamic pricing, when the price is changed according to the demand in order to maximize profit without losing clients.

â–¶ Improve marketing campaigns, as one can harness the full potential of the data by effectively segmenting the audiences to be sent personalized messages that would increase the engagement and conversion rates.

â–¶ Improve operational effectiveness through data analytics in identifying bottlenecks and optimizing supply chains for products to get into the right store at the right time, eliminating costs, and improving customer satisfaction.

The impact of data-driven decision-making is huge and undeniable. It has completely changed companies from what is successful today: highly agile, responsive to changes in the market, and able to change strategies with speed and precision.
