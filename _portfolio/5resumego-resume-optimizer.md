ResumeGo is an innovative AI-powered application designed to help job seekers optimize their resumes for better matching with job descriptions. Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI (powered by Cohere's Command R+), the system analyzes both resumes and job descriptions, identifying key areas for improvement. ResumeGo adjusts resume content to align with the job description by enhancing keyword relevance, improving section organization, and providing real-time feedback. In addition, the tool evaluates the resumeâ€™s strengths and weaknesses and offers actionable suggestions to improve the applicationâ€™s chances of passing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
