Conducted a comprehensive business analytics study for WeCoffee, a specialty coffee chain in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, to evaluate performance and identify growth opportunities. The project involved developing a structured learning agenda, collecting and cleaning diverse datasets, and performing in-depth analyses including EDA, statistical modeling, ANOVA, time-series forecasting, and market basket analysis. Data visualizations using Power BI were employed to communicate insights effectively. Key outcomes included a 15% increase in average transaction value through optimized product offerings, and a 10% reduction in inventory costs via improved forecasting. The project demonstrated the application of data science techniques to solve real-world business problems, driving tangible improvements in performance and informing strategic decision-making.
