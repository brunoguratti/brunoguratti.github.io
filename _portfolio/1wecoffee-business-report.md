### Overview

As the lead data analyst, I developed a structured learning agenda to guide WeCoffeeâ€™s growth strategy. This project required thorough data collection, cleaning, and integration from multiple sources, followed by detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced statistical modeling. Key analyses included ANOVA to assess performance variances across locations, time-series forecasting for demand predictions, and market basket analysis to optimize product offerings.

### Tools and Technologies Used

- **Power BI:** Utilized for visually communicating findings, offering clear, interactive dashboards that enabled stakeholders to grasp insights quickly.
- **Python (pandas, scikit-learn, and statsmodels):** Selected for data wrangling, statistical modeling, and exploratory analysis due to its versatility and rich library ecosystem.
- **SQL:** Used to query and manage large datasets, facilitating efficient data extraction and transformation.
- **Excel:** Employed for preliminary analysis and data organization before modeling.

These tools provided a comprehensive framework for efficient data processing and reliable analytical outputs, significantly reducing analysis time.

### Statistical and Analytical Techniques

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified key trends and anomalies across different sales and performance metrics.
- **ANOVA:** Applied to evaluate variations in performance across WeCoffeeâ€™s locations, identifying areas for improvement.
- **Time Series Forecasting:** Enabled accurate demand forecasting, which directly informed inventory management.
- **Market Basket Analysis:** Analyzed purchasing patterns, leading to optimized product placement and targeted promotions that increased transaction values.

Each method was selected to uncover meaningful patterns and inform actionable strategies that addressed WeCoffeeâ€™s business needs.
