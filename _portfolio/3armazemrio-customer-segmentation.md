### Project Description
As the lead data scientist, I implemented a machine learning clustering analysis on ArmazÃ©m RIO's transactional data, identifying key customer segments. This segmentation revealed three distinct customer groups, allowing the marketing team to craft personalized promotions. My responsibilities included data preprocessing, model selection, and delivering insights for strategic marketing initiatives. Overcoming challenges in data standardization and analysis, I ensured the segments were actionable and aligned with business goals.

### Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python (pandas, ydata_profiling, scikit-learn)**: Used for data exploration, profiling, and implementing clustering models.
- **Seaborn and Matplotlib**: Leveraged for data visualization to effectively communicate findings and segment characteristics.
- **SQL**: Employed for efficient data extraction and aggregation from transactional records.

These tools facilitated data-driven segmentation, making it possible to uncover actionable insights quickly.

### Statistical and Analytical Techniques
- **Clustering Analysis**: Used K-Means clustering to segment customers into three distinct groups based on purchasing behavior.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduced data dimensionality, which improved clustering performance and visualization clarity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified trends and informed feature engineering for more accurate clustering.
