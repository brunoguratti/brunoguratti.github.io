ArmazÃ©m RIO is a retail clothing store that was looking to improve their marketing campaigns through marketing segmentation. Utilizing machine learning clustering analysis on transactional data, it was possible to identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior. Our segmentation revealed three key customer groups, enabling targeted marketing campaigns and personalized promotions. The implementation resulted in a 22% increase in customer retention rate, a 15% boost in average transaction value, and a 30% improvement in marketing ROI within six months.
