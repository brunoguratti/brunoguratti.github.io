Utilizing machine learning clustering analysis on transactional data, it was identified distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning using Python and scikit-learn.

The implementation resulted in a 22% increase in customer retention rate, a 15% boost in average transaction value, and a 30% improvement in marketing ROI within six months.
