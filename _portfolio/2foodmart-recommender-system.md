Developed and implemented a recommendation system using market basket analysis to boost online sales for a Foodmart, a local grocery store. The system suggests products based on current cart contents, purchase history, and popular item combinations. After integration with the e-commerce platform, online sales increased 17% within three months, along with a 12% improvement in average order value. This project also enhanced the shopping experience with a 25% rise in products viewed per user session.
