### Project Description
In this project, I designed and implemented a recommendation engine using market basket analysis for Foodmartâ€™s e-commerce platform. The system analyzed customers' cart contents, purchase histories, and common item combinations to provide real-time product recommendations. My role encompassed data analysis and model development. 

### Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python (pandas, scikit-learn)**: Essential for data preprocessing and model development.
- **SQL**: Used to manage and retrieve large datasets efficiently.

### Statistical and Analytical Techniques
- **Market Basket Analysis**: Leveraged association rules to identify frequent itemsets and drive product recommendations.
