ðŸ“… January, 2023

Developed and implemented a recommendation system using market basket analysis to boost online sales for a local grocery store. The system suggests products based on current cart contents, purchase history, and popular item combinations. After integration with the e-commerce platform, we saw 17% increase in online sales within three months, along with a 12% improvement in average order value. The project not only generated significant revenue growth but also enhanced the shopping experience; we algo got a 25% rise in products viewed per session.
